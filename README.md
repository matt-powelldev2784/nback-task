### Project plan in bullet points

* Responsive design
* User needs to input their name before game starts
* Create random seqence of 15 letters
* Show one letter at a time for 2.2 seconds
* User has to press a key if letter that was shown 2 steps back is displayed again
* Task ends if 2 error or maximum of 15 letters displayed
* App to show number of correct answers and errors at end of game
* Log correct answers and errors including date/time to local storage to mimic backend
* Make user friendly and engaging
* Create repo on github with README.md and instruction to get started
* Deploy on Amazon S3
